Week 5 Challenge to build a work day calendar 

## Description 

I created the weather app as a project to create a dashboard that displayed the current weather and a 5 day forecast when a location is put in. I created the dashboard from scratch, using html, css and javascript with the open weather API.

## User Story

AS A traveler
I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria 

GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

## How to Use 

1. Clone the repository
2. Open in the web browser 
3. Input a location and click search button, then displayed the current weather and the 5 day forecast  
4. The location is also saved to local storage even when refreshed. Press clear searches to clear recent locations
